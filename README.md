Project is a result of participation in ["Power Laws: Optimizing Demand-side Strategies" competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/53/optimize-photovoltaic-battery/) hosted by Schneider Electric.

**OBJECTIVE:**
- create an optimization algorithm that effectively uses available solar power, building energy consumption, and a battery system to buy, sell, and consume energy in the way that saves the most money and puts the least demand on the energy grid

**RESULTS:**
- up to 12% of savings were achieved by using RL algorithms (DQN, DDPG, A3C, PG, PPO)
- up to 18% of savings were achieved by using MILP (Gurobi, CBC, GLOP)
- participation in WCGO2021 conference - ["Optimizing Energy Demand-side Strategies for Energy Storage System Control using Linear Programming"](http://caopt.com/WCGO2021/WCGO_2021_Conference_Program.pdf)
